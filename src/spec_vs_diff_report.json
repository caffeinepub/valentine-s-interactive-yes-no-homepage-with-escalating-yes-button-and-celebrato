  "summary": "Homepage Valentine interaction and modal were implemented, but several requirements/constraints are not met: exact button labels/text fidelity, required image asset presence, and unnecessary backend/auth-related additions.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Two clearly labeled buttons are present: “Yes” and “No” (exact labels).",
      "reason": "The Yes button label is not exactly “Yes”; it includes extra punctuation/emoji (“Yes! 💕”). The No button label is truncated in the diff, so exact compliance can’t be confirmed.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Modal displays the provided message text exactly (including punctuation and line break).",
      "reason": "The modal text differs from the requested exact text: it uses a straight apostrophe in \"don't\" instead of the curly apostrophe in “don’t”, and the second line appears to be missing the final period present in the request. The requested text is also specified as a single note with an exact line break; the implementation splits it into separate heading/paragraph elements (which may visually create a line break but does not guarantee exact text rendering).",

      "requirement": "Add the required generated image file under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` with the exact filename `valentine-popup-illustration.dim_1024x1024.png`.",
      "reason": "The UI references `/assets/generated/valentine-popup-illustration.dim_1024x1024.png`, but the diff summary does not show the image file being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`.",

      "description": "Added/implemented Internet Identity and actor/query hooks (`useInternetIdentity`, `useActor`) and wrapped the app in `InternetIdentityProvider` and React Query providers.",
      "reason": "The build request lists Internet Identity integration as a non-goal and also constrains not to modify immutable hook entrypoints (these files are introduced/changed outside the Valentine UI scope).",
