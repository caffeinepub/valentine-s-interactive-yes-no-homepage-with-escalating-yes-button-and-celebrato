  "summary": "REQ-26 image assets were not added (no new files in the diff). App.tsx was updated to use getAssetUrl(...) for the default main image, but the diff snippet is truncated and does not conclusively show the required secondary image rendering or confirm absence of absolute-root asset paths.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "Add `IMG_20260208_030749-3.jpg` and `image-1.jpg` under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` with exact filenames so they are served as public static assets.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files; therefore the two required image files are not present in the changes provided.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"ADDED FILES: - none\""
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Render `image-1.jpg` visibly on the homepage via `getAssetUrl('assets/generated/image-1.jpg')` as an additional photo element that does not interfere with Yes/No interactions and Yes-button growth.",
      "reason": "App.tsx is truncated and the provided visible portion only demonstrates the main image default using `getAssetUrl('assets/generated/IMG_20260208_030749-3.jpg')`; it does not show any code that renders the secondary `image-1.jpg` element or its layout/interaction safety.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)",
        "frontend/src/App.tsx: `useClientImagePreview(getAssetUrl('assets/generated/IMG_20260208_030749-3.jpg'))`"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Ensure all homepage references to the new default assets use `getAssetUrl(...)` (no `src=\"/assets/...\"` absolute-root paths).",
      "reason": "Because App.tsx is truncated, the diff does not provide enough evidence to verify that there are no remaining absolute-root (`/assets/...`) references elsewhere in the homepage component.",
