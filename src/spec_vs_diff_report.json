  "summary": "REQ-17 and REQ-18 appear implemented by switching the homepage and modal default image sources to the requested static asset URLs. REQ-16 is not implemented because the actual image files were not added to `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (no added files in the diff). The diff also includes several unrelated styling/config and robustness changes not requested by REQ-16–18.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, so the required JPG assets are not present under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` in this change set.",
